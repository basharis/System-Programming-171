# System Programming 171 (SPL)

My assignments from System Programming course (CS Bsc. Sem #3).


## Assignment 1: Reviiyot in C++

The objective of this assignment was to design an object-oriented system and gain implementation experience in C++ while using classes, standard data structures and unique C++ properties such as the “Rule of 5”. We have learned to handle memory in C++ and avoid memory leaks.

## Assignment 2: Work Stealing Thread Pool in Java

In this assignment, we were required to implement a work stealing scheduler, testing it by implementing a simple parallel merge sort algorithm, and afterwards to use it to build a smart phone factory. The work stealing principle in this assignment can be synthesized as follows: Pool of Threads P_1, P_2, ..., P_n where each thread runs a Processor, each with own queue are working in order to complete tasks in their queues. When a processor P_i is out of tasks it attempts to steal some from its neighbors.
The goal of this assignment was to learn the principals of concurrent programming in Java.

## Assignment 3: TFTP Server in Java and Client in C++

The goal of this assignment was to create an extended TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) server and client. The communication between the server and the client(s) is performed using a binary communication protocol, which supports the upload, download and lookup of files.
The implementation of the server is based on the Reactor and Thread-Per-Client (TPC) design-petterns.

## Assignment 4: Cron Job in Python and SQLite

𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑛 is an important Unix utility that allows tasks to automatically run in the system in a scheduled manner. In this assignment, I have implemented a simplified version of 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑛 that manages a 'hotel' using 𝑷𝒚𝒕𝒉𝒐𝒏 and 𝑺𝑸𝑳𝒊𝒕𝒆.
